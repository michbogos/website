I like exploring new horizons in programming, graphics and AI reserch.\n          I have experience in problem solving. I've solved a tens of Project Euler problems and implemented various algorithms: raycasting,\n          different search algorithms, optimization algorithms for machine learning like gradient descent. \n        </p>\n        <p>\n          With the help of these algorithms I was able to program my own simple 3d renderer, that can read the object files and display then on the screen.\n          I experimented with Opengl and learned about shaders. I'm familiar with the Unity game engine and have made a simple game in it. I also use graphics\n          libraries like: pygame, olcPixelGameEngine, sdl, p5.js and glfw.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Recently I have tried to visualise different algorithms with these graphics libraries. I'm interested in physics simulation. I have created a gravity\n          simulator and a simple fluid simulator.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Right now I'm exploring machine learning techniques. I'm accustomed to libraries such as Tensorflow, NEAT, numpy and currently learning Pytorch. With\n          the use of these frameworks I've traines several neural networks to: play flappy bird, do sentiment analysis, generate images of handwritten digits, faces\n           and stylize images.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I develop react websites with node.js, and express.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <footer></footer>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
